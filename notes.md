# App will have two pages

A home page
  Should show the log in page if not logged in.
  If the user is logged in, the page should say hi, name and provide
  a log out link.
A login
  Users can enter their name in a form and click login.
  If the user doesn't put in a name or it is nil, then it will be returned
  to the login page.
