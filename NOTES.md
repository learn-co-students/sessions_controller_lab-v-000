# Create sessions controller
# Route root
# So, the root page, hello.html.erb, says 'Hi session[:username]' with a logout option
  ~ I need to make a conditional that shows this to the user if they are logged in, and renders the
    new.html.erb page if they are not logged in.  
# Perhaps, the first thing I should do is create a destroy option.
# Need to make a destroy template
# Look at rspec test
